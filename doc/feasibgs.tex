    galaxies are within the DESI footprint. This makes them
    an excellent sample to assess the feasibility of BGS.}

    relations for galaxies that are in both the GAMA DR 2 and the 
    Legacy survey DR 5. The $(g - r)$ and $(r - z)$ colors are calculated
    from the Legacy survey DR 5 model flux. Meanwhile the $H_\alpha$ line 
    flux is from the GAMA DR 2, where they fit a Gaussian to the emission 
    line. For convenience, the galaxy sample is downsampled by a factor of 
    $10$.}
